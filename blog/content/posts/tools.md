# Tools
Software are getting all these smart tools that can do all kind of fancy stuff for a small fee.

I generally like the idea behind it but often a tool ends up being something you'll have to learn. If you have to spend time learning something why not learn the technology behind it all, so you have more freedom?

I realise that knowing the tool behind it all sometimes still demand a lot of handheld work which you can skip with a tool. I just prefer having simple tools automating the repetitive and hard tasks and then leaving the rest open to use. 

If you have used an ORM for database calls you know that it's sometimes super smart and sometimes irritating. You can do basic calls super easy without writing SQL. Often you can also insert SQL directly in some way. I just don't understand what's dangerous about SQL. If you collect everything in SQL files you'll have direct control about precisely what happens where. 

I could write for ages about ORMs. I don't mind them. I have tried using them where it was really convenient and I tried using it where the integration and the breaking changes was not worth it.
