## Hugo as a tool for making a blog

This is my first test with Hugo. So far the response time is incredibly fast and the documentation is really easy to follow along. I am pleasantly surprised that it uses MarkDown files to post pages. This means I can make a vault and edit my posts in Obsidian, which I have grown quite fund of as a note/idea tool.
