## Hosting is always a question
There are tons of hosting options out there with a ton of different options.

Many companies normally defaults to either Microsoft or Amazon because they believe they need the capabilities or support. I have not been a place that truly needed anything from them. It might also be something about availability, developer experiences and too big to fail.

I think it is a shame that they don't try other places. 

I have been a fan of Digital Ocean for a long time, because it was super simple and I have only used it for small scale sites. They are now transitioning to making more money, which I understand, but that bloats their site, with one click AI installations and all kinds of smart stuff I don't need.

I still use them but mainly because of familiarity. With the new political landscape I would also like to support more European companies.

I do like how their App Platform let's me have a super simple CI/CD integration with Github and one click deployment where it figures out most behind the scenes. It's really smart when it works. But as you know, sometimes you want to do custom stuff and then it's a tool to learn and then you might as well learn and setup a simple nginx config.
